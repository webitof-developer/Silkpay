FAQ
Q:How to pay repeatedly?
A: If the payment status is FAILED, please call /transaction/payin/v2 again to create a new payment order.
Q:What should I do if the callback fails?
A:Merchants need to return the string OK after receiving the callback to confirm that the callback is successful, otherwise we will retry 5 times.
Q:How ofter in % of transactions the amount requested by user will differ?
A:It depends on the type of bank account we are using.
In the current Indian payment environment, whether it's a corporate account or a savings account, users are often required at the technical level to pay the full amount including decimals.
However, on our side, we always send the callback based on the original order amount, and the credited balance (after deducting the payin fee) is also based on the order amount — not the amount actually received.
Q:Do you support changed amount (if user's requested 300 but paid 350)?
A:We do not support payments with modified amounts.
However, some users — including fraudsters — intentionally change the amount. In such cases, we will not trigger a success callback, but the actual payment amount will still be credited to your available balance in our system for reconciliation.
Please note that based on our experience, most of these modified-amount payments are related to suspicious or fraudulent activity.
Q:Do you use UTR check to finalize transactions?
A:Yes, we use UTR checks as part of our transaction confirmation process.
If the payment is received but the order is not marked as successful, you can resubmit the UTR and order ID via our Telegram bot or through API for resubmitting UTR/orders.
Q:What should I do if the order amount is inconsistent with the actual payment amount?
A:We will refund according to the actual amount received
